## Abstract
Most of the Binary Search Tree operation (e.g., search, max, min, insert) take O(h) time where h is the height of the Binary Search Tree.

The cost of these operation can become O(n) if the tree is skewed.

That's why people invented Red Black Tree which is a balanced Tree structure which always maintain its height to make sure that each operation only cost O(log n) worstly where n is the number of nodes.
## Functionality
**The implementation supports the following operations**

1. Printing node's details
2. Searching for a key inside the Red Black Tree
3. Inserting a key into the Red Black Tree
4. Printing Tree Size
5. Printing Tree Height
6. Printing the Tree itself
## Tools
1. PyCharm (IDE)
2. Python
